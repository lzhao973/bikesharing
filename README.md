Since we observed the proportion of gender, subscribers and customers, we know most of them use bike to work, and the location they are going to is downtown by looking at the distribution of map for the station. Now I list two more images to show the age of people who use the bike, it's clearly to see the age is between 20 to 50, customers age around 50 use bike more than subscribers. The further analysis can be the willingness to pay for different ages and how many years they would stay in the contract.
